Simulation Environment
======================

The ``general_sim_env.py`` module implements ``SimEnv``, a custom Gym-compatible
environment for reinforcement learning simulations over optical networks.

This class supports multi-agent training and evaluation, integrated with dynamic
spectrum assignment and topology-aware step logic.
